Organized a Father's Day palm painting activity to observe childrenâ€™s hand washing performance; collected data on washing time, hand sanitizer use, whether their actions were standardized and complete. Prototyped to verify whether children would get into the habit of hand washing; aimed to achieve the same effect as UN's seven-step method after children engaged with the model.
