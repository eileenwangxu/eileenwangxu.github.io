### Cultural Product Design for 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games
The inspiration comes from the combination of curling with the architectural appearance of the main stadiums and the mascot image of the Winter Olympics. Meanwhile, the colors are taken from the five Olympic rings, which symbolize the unity and friendship of the five continents. One is a souvenir, and the other is fridge magnets plus sticky notes.

### ReConnect, FourC Challenge 24-hour Charrette Contest
This is an interactive luninous device for post-epidemic era, aiming to solve the disconnection between real death and virtual death. As Takeshi Kitano said, "This is not one incident in which 20,000 people died. It is 20,000 incidents, in each of which one person died." The sun, the rain, the soil, nourishing the frangipani. The love, the miss, the remembrance, lighting up “Frangipani”.

### Chess Design and Prototyping
We adopted the form of gear and industrial style because we believed that chess is like a closely linked machinery, and only when each individual has a clear division of labor and sacrifices can the final victory be achieved. In addition, we visualized the moves of each piece and added it in its form, so that beginners could easily get started. Innovation was also made on its receiving way.

### Dreaming of Space, Clay Modeling
Due to the pandemic, I could not go to the school lab to make car models, so I made a steampunk-style clay model at home. After the creation of the form, the clay is heated and softened by a hair dryer, repeatedly kneaded and scraped, and decorated with solder wire, copper wire, lead strip, buttons, rivets and acrylic hemisphere.

### Paintings
During my major studies, I learned pencil sketching, gouache painting, drawing from life, design sketching, and markers. These are some of the works that I've made along the way. In addition, I also actively practiced calligraphy in my spare time. I hope to cultivate my patience and concentration, as well as improve my modeling and expression ability.
