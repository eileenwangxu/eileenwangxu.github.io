I designed the experimental scheme first, and found six kinds of materials to test the adsorption capacity by conducting a lot of experiments. Compared to our first-generation prototype, I successfully altered the way in which scent is stored and emitted, optimizing the hardware system to reduce the volume of the device and extend the storage time of the scent.

### Surface modification of multiwalled carbon nanotube was carried out.

Through the oxidation modification of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid:

1. the tube length is shortened
2. the specific surface area is increased
3. the surface nitrogen-containing and oxygen-containing functional groups are increased
4.  its adsorption capacity enhanced

### Ion migration spectroscopy was used to analyze the adsorption performance of the material.

In the process, I found that the existing physical or chemical adsorption apparatus was only suitable for analyzing the adsorption capacity of the material to a specific or several mixed gases, which could not meet the test requirements.

So my team and I designed new analytical instruments together.
